This is a Python implementation of the classic Hand Cricket game, where one player against the computer use random numbers to score runs. It’s a fun, beginner-friendly project designed to help you practice Python programming and game logic.

Features:
Single-Player Mode: Play against the computer, which generates random numbers as the opponent.
Score Keeping: Automatically tracks and displays scores, announcing the winner once the game ends.
Simple Console Interface: Intuitive console-based interface for easy interaction.

How to Play:
Each player chooses a number between 1 and 6.
If the player and computer select the same number, the batsman is out.
The goal is to score as many runs as possible before getting out.

Technologies Used:
Python: The core language used to build the game.
Random Module: Used to generate random numbers for the computer opponent.
Basic I/O: To interact with the players through the console.

Learning Outcomes:
Randomization: Use Python’s random module.
Game Logic: Develop the core logic of a turn-based game.
User Input: Handle and validate user inputs in the console.
